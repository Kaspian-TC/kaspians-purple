# kaspians-purple README

I made this theme for VS code to match a similar theme I made for notepad++ when writing C files. It's my first theme so don't expect anything amazing, but it's mine and I like it. 

If you find anything you'd like to improve, feel free to make a pull request and I'll get to it when I can!
